### Full Stack for Front-End Developers: Build your first AWS Amplify and React App intro
---
In this course, you will learn how to build fullstack applications with AWS Amplify Studio. We'll build a note-taking app with authentication, authorization, and data. We'll also be using Amplify Studio's Figma to generate code that encourages a straight transition from design to React components.

If you are a front end developer looking to build fullstack apps, then you are at the right place!

### Decision condition

- Knowledge of React, including states, event handlers, and props.
- How to use the command line interface on your computer. You don't have to be an expert though!
- Although this course is not completely required, you may want to learn about Figma before building your own applications with AWS Amplify Studio.

### Things you will build

- We will build a note taking app with the following features:
- All notes are listed on the homepage
- Ability to create, update and delete notes
- User accounts have the ability to login, create accounts and log out
- Users can only view and modify their own notes
