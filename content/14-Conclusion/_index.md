### Conclude

You've now built a complete app with authentication, authorization, data, and a React UI built using AWS Amplify Studio.

### Next step

To test your skills and keep learning Amplify, you can add more features to this app, for example:

- Add images to your notes. Enable storage via Amplify Studio, then use [Amplify JS Library](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/storage/getting-started/q/platform/js/) to access the images in your application.
- Turn your app into a Next.js app, then move some of your backend logic to the side. server .
- Write logic and authorization rules so that notes can be shared between users (for example, you can share a to-do list with your significant other).
