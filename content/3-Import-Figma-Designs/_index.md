In this lesson, we'll use AWS Amplify Studio to convert designs from the popular design tool Figma to React components.

### Instruct

1. Go to **UI Library** in Studio. Select **Sync with Figma**.

For this course, I pre-created a remixed Figma file from the original Amplify UI Kit for your use. has the necessary components for the note taking application. Click **get a copy** on Figma to use it. You'll be prompted to create a Figma account if you don't already have one -- this project is on their free tier.

2. Select **My Components** you will see your UI components in Amplify Studio

Amplify Studio allows you to take these components and export them to human-readable React code - we'll do this in a few lessons!
